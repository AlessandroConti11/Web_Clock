## Specification

The project aims to develop an interactive visualization of an analog clock, a digital clock and a stopwatch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies.

The analog clock has a faithful representation of the hands, which move dynamically according to the current time.

The digital clock, on the other hand, will display the time in numerical format, updated in real time.

The stopwatch will measure the amount of time between its activation and deactivation including laps.
